Exploring Cloud Computing with Docker: A Journey from Flask to Containers
As I delve deeper into the fascinating world of cloud computing, I realized that understanding the core concepts behind modern deployment technologies is crucial for building scalable and efficient applications. After some research and hands-on experimentation, I decided to explore Docker, a powerful platform that simplifies containerization and the deployment of applications across different environments.

Through this journey, Iâ€™ve gained practical knowledge on how to work with Docker and its various components. Iâ€™d like to share the steps I took to containerize a simple Flask Python application, manage Docker images, and integrate tools like Docker Compose for more advanced use cases.

Topics covered:
* What is docker?
* Docker images vs container
* Building a basic application using Flask for just testing docker
* Building docker images
* Running images in docker container 
* Pushing docker image to Docker
* Docker Compose 

Commands used:
* Building docker images
* Running docker images to container
* Container running status check
* Docker deletion command
* Docker name changing command
* Pushing images to docker hub repository
* Docker pulling command
* Docker detaching command
* Docker compose up and stop commands
